# Terms and Conditions of Use – KILT Token Migration Portal

These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the KILT Token Migration Portal (the “Portal”), a service offered by a British Virgin Islands-based entity (the “Entity”) for the purpose of migrating KILT tokens from the existing Base network contract to a new Base network contract. By using the Portal, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. Eligibility

The Portal enables you to voluntarily destroy (burn) your existing KILT tokens on the existing Base network contract and receive an amount of KILT tokens on the new Base network contract.

### 2.2
The migration occurs on a 1:1.75 basis. For every 1 KILT token you burn on the existing Base network contract, you will receive 1.75 KILT tokens on the new Base network contract.

### 2.3
The amount received is automatically calculated based on the quantity of tokens verifiably burned, and is final and non-reversible.

### 2.4
The Entity makes no guarantees about the value, exchangeability, or usability of the new tokens beyond their utility within the KILT ecosystem.

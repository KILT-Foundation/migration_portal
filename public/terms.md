# Terms and Conditions of Use - KILT Migration Portal

**Last Updated: June 18, 2025**

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the KILT Token Migration Portal - [https://migrate.kilt.io/](https://migrate.kilt.io/) (the "Portal"), a decentralized, non-custodial software service operated by Claymore Ltd., a British Virgin Islands-based entity (the "Entity"), for the purpose of migrating KILT tokens from the old Base contract to the new Base contract, such that post-migration, all KILT tokens (including native KILT) will exist solely on the new Base contract. By accessing or using the Portal, you agree to be bound by these Terms, which are valid, binding, and enforceable against you. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Portal.

## 1. Definitions

* Portal: The online, decentralized, and autonomous user interface and smart contract mechanisms facilitating the migration of KILT tokens from the old Base contract to the new Base contract.
* Services: The software functionalities provided by the Portal, including displaying migration information and enabling interaction with smart contracts for token burning and issuance.
* Digital Assets: Cryptographic tokens, including KILT tokens, used in connection with the Portal.
* You/User: Any individual or entity accessing or using the Portal.

## 2. Eligibility

### 2.1

You represent and warrant that:

* You are at least 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction.
* You have full legal capacity and authority to agree to these Terms.
* You are not located in, incorporated, or resident of a restricted jurisdiction as outlined in Section 11.
* Your use of the Portal complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and sanctions in your jurisdiction.
* You are not listed on any excluded or denied persons lists, including but not limited to the U.S. OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List, EU Consolidated Sanctions List, or UK Sanctions List.

### 2.2

You acknowledge that you are not using the Portal as a consumer under applicable consumer protection laws, and you are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of the Services for your purposes.

## 3. Nature of the Migration

### 3.1

The Portal enables you to voluntarily destroy (burn) your existing KILT tokens on the old Base contract and to receive new KILT tokens on the new Base contract at a 1:1.75 ratio (1 KILT token burned on the old Base contract yields 1.75 KILT tokens on the new Base contract). Upon completion of the migration process, all KILT tokens, including native KILT and those currently existing on Ethereum or Base, will exist solely on the new Base contract, and no KILT tokens will remain valid or supported on the KILT blockchain, Ethereum blockchain or the old Base contract.

### 3.2

The migration is executed programmatically via smart contracts, with the amount of new tokens issued determined solely by the verifiable destruction of old tokens. Once the migration window closes, no further migrations will be permitted, and unmigrated KILT tokens will cease to be recognized or be functional within the KILT ecosystem.

### 3.3

The Entity makes no guarantees regarding the value, exchangeability, or usability of the new KILT tokens beyond their utility within the KILT ecosystem, nor is it liable for any loss of value or functionality of unmigrated native KILT tokens or KILT tokens on the old Base contract.

### 3.4

You are solely responsible for:

* Verifying the official Portal and smart contract addresses published in the official communication channels of KILT - [https://www.kilt.io/](https://www.kilt.io/), [https://x.com/Kiltprotocol](https://x.com/Kiltprotocol), [https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat](https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat).
* Using accurate wallet addresses and the correct networks (Base for burning, Base for receiving).
* Safeguarding your wallet credentials, private keys, and seed phrases.
* Completing the migration of your KILT tokens from the old Base contract to the new Base contract before the migration window closes, as unmigrated tokens will no longer be valid or supported.

### 3.5

The Entity is not responsible for losses due to:

* User error (e.g., incorrect addresses or networks).
* Failure to migrate tokens before the migration window closes.
* Interactions with counterfeit or malicious sites or smart contracts.
* Failures caused by incompatible wallets, third-party services, or blockchain network issues.
